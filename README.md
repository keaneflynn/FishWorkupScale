# Automated fish workup scale

Hello! Welcome to yet another of my neural network fisheries contraptions. In this git repo, we will be capturing fish images through an intel RealSense camera which will then be used for object detection and length measurements. The computer will also be connected to the serial port via usb to an Ohaus Ranger series scale to obtain weight values.
